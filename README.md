# CHOA-algorithm-design-optimization
Meta-heuristic optimization methods are essential for solving complex engineering problems, yet they often struggle with early convergence and high computational costs. Our study demonstrates that the Cultural History Optimization Algorithm (CHOA) effectively overcomes these challenges, offering a robust solution for large-scale optimization tasks. This paper presents a novel human-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, CHOA, evaluated against 47 benchmark functions and the CEC06âˆ’2019 test suite. CHOA exhibits strong exploration and exploitation capabilities, achieving global optima with rapid convergence. Key findings include its superior performance metrics, such as mean cost and convergence acceleration, and its ability to avoid local optima in large-scale design optimization problems. However, more work is still needed to explore CHOA's full potential in various applications, but its implications for scalable and efficient optimization are promising.
